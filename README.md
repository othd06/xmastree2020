Designed For Matt Parker's 500 LED xmas tree


This code may not be perfect as I have not had a chance to test it, for obvious reasons. If you see a bug feel free to fix it. The code is designed to move a virtual sphere up and down through Matt's christmas tree with consantly increasing and decreasing radius. This sphere will be shown in the real world by the LEDs he has placed on there that will glow in a colour designated ColourA that will also constantly cycle rather slowly (I think).
