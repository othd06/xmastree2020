Designed For Matt Parker's 500 LED xmas tree


Thanks to the great simulators that have now been created, especially that of YgorSouza, I can confirm that the code should almost certainly be in a workable state however if you see a bug feel free to fix it. The code is designed to move a virtual sphere up and down through Matt's christmas tree with consantly increasing and decreasing radius. This sphere will be shown in the real world by the LEDs he has placed on there that will glow in a colour designated ColourA that will also constantly cycle at a steady pace. the clour cycling is not well optomised to work for colours however the whole code does work and the result is still visually pleasing.
